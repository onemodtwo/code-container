# Changelog

## v3.6.0

Additions:

- `tool_permissions` config field with restrictive defaults: blocks network commands (`curl`, `wget`, `pip`, `npm`, `ssh`, etc.) inside containers for security hardening
- `install.json` now includes all configurable fields: `penv_path`, `renv_path`, `extra_readonly`, `extra_readwrite`, `extra_ld_library_path`, `tool_permissions`
- `penv_path` now supports relative paths, resolved against the project directory
- Dockerfile creates `/home/user → /root` symlink so absolute symlinks referencing the host home directory continue to resolve inside the container
- `buildMounts()` returns `{ mounts, containerProjectPath }` for callers needing the in-container project path

Changes:

- Package renamed from `@aerovato/container` to `@onemodtwo/code-container`
- License changed from MIT to BSD-3-Clause
- Project directory mounted at `/root/<projectName>` instead of `<hostPath>:<hostPath>` for cleaner in-container paths
- `-w` flag uses the in-container project path (`/root/<projectName>`) so users land in their project directory
- `PENV_PATH` env var only set when the resolved host path actually exists (`fs.existsSync` guard)
- Removed dead `SETTINGS_PATH` export from `paths.ts`
- Swept remaining Aerovato branding from source files and tests
- README replaced with generalized multi-tool documentation

## v3.5.1

Fixes:

- `git-config` tool pack now mounts `~/.config/git` (XDG git config directory)

## v3.5.0

Additions:

- `container version` subcommand to print the installed version
- Automatic runtime startup: `container` now starts Docker Desktop or Podman Machine when the runtime is not running, with context-aware Linux service selection (`systemctl` user/system services based on Docker context)

Changes:

- `container upgrade` now checks for a newer version first and reports "already up to date" instead of re-running the installer
- `container settings` no longer requires a running runtime; image rebuild is deferred with a dirty flag when no runtime is available

## v3.4.6

Changes:

- Rewrite update notification throttling to skip checks only within one day of a successful `container upgrade`

## v3.4.5

Fixes:

- Stop mounting Claude Code's install directory, preventing persisted config mounts from shadowing the image-installed Claude binary versions

## v3.4.4

Additions:

- First class support for Pi (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`), mounting `~/.pi` → `/root/.pi`
- `agents-directory` tool pack mounting the shared `~/.agents` → `/root/.agents`, enabled by default

## v3.4.3

Fixes:

- Windows standalone installer now verifies release checksums with .NET SHA256 hashing instead of `Get-FileHash`, fixing `container upgrade` on systems where the cmdlet is unavailable in the spawned PowerShell session

## v3.4.2

Fixes:

- Prevent Docker bind-mount failures caused by missing config sources: file and directory config mounts are now pre-created with the correct type before mounting, and existing wrong-type sources are auto-repaired
- Switched bind mounts from `-v` to `--mount type=bind`, which errors instead of silently creating a missing source
- SSH mount is skipped when `~/.ssh` is absent rather than failing container creation

## v3.4.1

Fixes:

- Binary targets glibc instead of musl for broader Linux compatibility
- `container upgrade` source detection now correctly handles nvm-managed Node
- `install.sh` PATH modification fixed

## v3.4.0

Additions:

- Standalone binary distribution: install `container` as a native binary with no Node.js dependency, via hosted installer scripts `install.sh` and `install.ps1`
- `container upgrade` command: detects whether `container` was installed via npm or as a standalone binary and runs the matching update flow
- In-binary auto-update: standalone installs upgrade themselves by re-invoking the hosted installers
- CI workflow that compiles Bun standalone binaries, packages release assets, and creates the GitHub Release on tag

Changes:

- Runtime setup and V2→V3 migration moved from the npm `postinstall` hook into CLI startup (`src/setup.ts`); the `Dockerfile.User` template is now embedded, so the standalone binary has no bundled file dependencies
- Removed `scripts/postinstall.js`

## v3.3.0

Additions:

- Native Windows support (win32 + Docker Desktop) alongside Linux, macOS, and WSL
- Platform abstraction layer (`src/platform/`) isolating all OS-dependent logic, enforced by an ESLint rule
- Drive-letter path canonicalization: native Windows and WSL paths for the same project resolve to one container
- New `internal/Specs/Windows.md` and Windows user guidance (now at `skills/container/references/windows.md`)
- Add runtime installation instructions to onboarding
- Modify onboarding to install a default set of harnesses if none are installed

Changes:

- File permission modes now no-op on Windows (Windows ACLs govern permissions)
- `commandExists` uses `where` on Windows (`which` on POSIX)
- Runtime default prefers Docker on Windows when both Docker and Podman are available

FYI:

- Tool and harness config paths remain POSIX-oriented; on Windows they resolve against the home directory and may need manual copying where a tool stores config elsewhere
- UNC paths are not supported as project directories
- See [Windows support](skills/container/references/windows.md) for full details

## v3.2.0

Additions:

- Added tool packs: configurable development tools that you can enable to install inside your container
- Some tool packs come with mounts for specific config files or directories
- New `container build tools` target to rebuild from Tools stage

Changes:

- Python moved from core image to optional tool pack
- Git config and Vim config added as config-only tool packs (mount host configs into container)
- Gitconfig removed from `systemMounts` (now managed via `git-config` tool pack)
- 4-stage build pipeline: Core → Tools → Harness → User

FYI:

- To configure which tools are enabled, choose "Custom Setup" during re-onboarding or run `container settings` and select "Enabled Tools"
- Use space to toggle tools and enter to confirm
- After changing tools, rebuild the image
